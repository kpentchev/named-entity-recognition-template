**Description**

Different Named Entity Recognition (NER) models built with:
* `Python`
* `Tensorflow`
* `Keras`

A trained model can be served as a web application using `flask`.
The application can be packaged as a `Docker` container and deployed to a `Kubernetes` cluster.


**Models**
- BiLSTM+CRF with character and stem embeddings
- BiLSTM+CRF with character and lemma embeddings
- BiLSTM+CRF with ELMO embeddings
